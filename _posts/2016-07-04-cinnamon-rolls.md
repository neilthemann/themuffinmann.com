## Description:
The cinnamon rolls are rolled out into a rectangle and covered with melted butter, sugar and cinnamon. They are rolled up and cut into about 1 inches. Then they are baked in the oven. After they are baked the cinnamon rolls are covered with a generous amount of delicious sweet frosting.

## Why this is a healthy choice:

The ingredients that I use in the items that I make are high quality and are non-GMO. I also used unbleached flour and unrefined sugar. When I had started school I wanted to start a healthier option of baked items that are good quality. As a mom of three I want the food that my kids are eating to be healthy. I don't want them to have preservatives in them or other ingredients that I know are bad for my kid's health.
